'' and he would also support a bid from former indiana gov. mitch daniels , whom ryan strongly lobbied to run in 2012 . `` but other than mitt and mitch , there 's not aâ $ '' , '' ryan said , stopping himself . the

"london -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- ever wondered where your cat goes after it leaves the house at night ? curious what your dog gets up to when it is off the leash ? one man was and he has now designed a gps tracking collar to get a glimpse into the private life of his pet . dave evans , from marlborough in the uk , wanted to work out why his cat yollo was putting on weight , so he designed a `` cat nav '' to track where he went at night . with his new gps collar , yollo 's secrets have been revealed , including his penchant for chasing chickens in the early hours of the morning . `` he was actually traveling a couple of miles pretty much every night , visiting other houses and we suspect those other houses were feeding him , '' says evans . now that the mystery of yollo 's expanding waistline has been solved , evans has developed the `` g-paws '' device he says will be available soon for purchase by other curious pet owners . animal tracking devices have been available for years using various technologies and at a wide range of costs so make sure to compare the various brands before purchasing one . g-paws is based on existing gps technology and the data can be plotted directly onto google earth . the light weight , waterproof device takes a recording every five seconds and evans says it is accurate to two or three meters so you can see the precise route of your furry friend . but g-paws does n't give live data -- so no real-time stalking -- which evans says has helped him keep the cost and weight of the unit down . it 's not just cats who are going to have their secrets blown -- the g-paws device can also be fitted to a dog 's collar . if you want to catch your lazy dog-walker , this could tell you exactly how many miles your pet is getting exercised each day . and evans says he 's even been approached by pigeon racers and hawk owners to see if the g-paws might work for their birds . `` everyone who owns a pet -- whether it 's a cat , a dog , a pigeon -- has got a curiosity"
