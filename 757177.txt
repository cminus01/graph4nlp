'' and he would also support a bid from former indiana gov. mitch daniels , whom ryan strongly lobbied to run in 2012 . `` but other than mitt and mitch , there 's not aâ $ '' , '' ryan said , stopping himself . the

"jerusalem -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- two attacks carried out against palestinians in recent days , one in jerusalem and the other on the west bank , have prompted some uncomfortable questions in israel about racism toward arabs . in one incident , jamal julani , a 17-year-old palestinian from east jerusalem , was beaten unconscious by a group of teenagers in west jerusalem . he spent several days in the hospital recovering from his injuries . on the same day , august 16 , a taxi carrying a palestinian family close to the israeli settlement of bat ayin on the west bank was firebombed . all six family members were injured , one badly . three children , ages 12 and 13 , have been arrested on suspicion of throwing the gasoline bomb . seven minors , as well as an adult , were indicted in the jerusalem case tuesday . among the charges they face are incitement to racism , incitement to violence and aggravated assault , and motivated racism . the youth of the alleged perpetrators and the fact they appear to have targeted their victims because of their race , and in the west bank case possibly also as a result of tensions between settlers and palestinians over land , have shocked many in israel . some believe an environment of conflict and lack of tolerance have combined to create dangerous behavioral instincts in the youth on both sides , undermining the chances of a peaceful resolution to the conflict . jerusalem city councilor laura wharton , who grew up in the united states but has lived in israel for many years , wrote in her blog that `` apart from sorrow i can only express my shame that such a thing could happen in my country . '' in the wake of the attacks , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu issued a strongly worded statement expressing the government 's `` complete opposition to racism and violence . '' but some , wharton among them , say this is not enough to tackle the deeper issues at stake . jamal julani 's cousin , 18-year-old nu'oman julani , described to cnn how the pair were in west jerusalem to shop for eid when they ran into a group of about 50 israeli settler youths shouting racist slogans in zion square . nu'oman julani said they tried to"
